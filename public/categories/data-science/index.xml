      <description>At work I often find myself with a new dataset. It is an exciting feeling to have successfully downloaded a large, recent dataset that is also clean. Often times I find these datasets need to be extracted from one of the platforms that we use at work. But without getting into how these datasets are extracted I will share some tips on how I approach the datasets in a way that helps me quickly derive some initial insights.</description>

      <description>Here is a simple trick to make the bars in a bar chart appear in order of their height - highest to lowest (or lowest to highest).
Let’s say we want to plot the number of cars of each class that we have in the mpg dataset.
library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) mpg %&amp;gt;% ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x = class)) If you look at class(mpg$class) you will see that it is:
## [1] &amp;quot;character&amp;quot; However, ggplot converts it into factor and if you convert it into factor you will notice that the orders in which the bars appear in the bar chart above is the same order in which the list has recorded the levels of the variable class.</description>

      <description>A simple task Sounds like a simple task. You have multiple CSV files in a folder. You want to import each of them into your environment but into a single data frame. Here is the challenge: most new R users have only used read.csv() to import single files. I remember, when I was an R beginner, the very first time when I wanted to import a whole bunch of CSV files, the task of running read.</description>
