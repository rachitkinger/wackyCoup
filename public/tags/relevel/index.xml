      <description>Here is a simple trick to make the bars in a bar chart appear in order of their height - highest to lowest (or lowest to highest).
Let’s say we want to plot the number of cars of each class that we have in the mpg dataset.
library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) mpg %&amp;gt;% ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x = class)) If you look at class(mpg$class) you will see that it is:
## [1] &amp;quot;character&amp;quot; However, ggplot converts it into factor and if you convert it into factor you will notice that the orders in which the bars appear in the bar chart above is the same order in which the list has recorded the levels of the variable class.</description>
