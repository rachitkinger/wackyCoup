### a note
wackyCoup is a collection of stuff that I think has been interesting enough or difficult enough (mostly latter) for me to learn. Through this blog I try to I develop a stronger understanding of the concepts I struggled with.  

Part of the insipiration behind this blog is a quote from [Elizabeth Gilbert](https://twitter.com/GilbertLiz): 

  > _"Your [work] not only doesn't have to be original... it also doesn't have to be important"_  

The blog is therefore mostly **un**important and **un**original.
