<p>At work I often find myself with a new dataset. It is an exciting feeling to have successfully downloaded a large, recent dataset that is also clean. Often times I find these datasets need to be extracted from one of the platforms that we use at work. But without getting into how these datasets are extracted I will share some tips on how I approach the datasets in a way that helps me quickly derive some initial insights. These insights help me start conversations with other stakeholders who might be interested in knowing what I have found, and based on quick discussions with them I often end up with a few projects which require me and my team to dive deeper into these datasets.</p>
