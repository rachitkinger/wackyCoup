When using Jupyter Notebooks I like to use the version of R that I use by default in RStudio and not Anconda R. To enable this I do the following:  

1. DO NOT install Anaconda R (assuming you have installed Anaconda)  
2. Using R in your terminal -- on linux it is `ctrl + alt + t` simply type R on the command line  
3. Once in R in your terminal (not in RStudio), install IRkernel package by typing `install.packages("IRkernel")` and enter  
4. After IRkernel is installed enter the command: `IRkernel::installspec()`  

This should do the trick. Now open Jupyter Notebook or Lab and you should be able to use your default R kernel.
