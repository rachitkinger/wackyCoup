My name is Rachit Kinger.  

I blog about things in data science and linux (sometimes general and random hacks). Basically, things I found difficult to understand or learn. Professionally, I am ~~head of data and analytics at a media company in the UK called JPIMedia~~ head of data science at [Codec](www.codec.ai).  

I love to hack solutions of all kinds: carpentry, plumbing, electrical circuits, cooking, gardening, bike fixing, my daughter's dresses and clothes, business problems and, last but not the least, data hacks!  



### Talk to me about    

* Digital media - understanding user behaviour to inform content strategy, subscription strategy _(psst. especially subscription strategy)_  
* Building data pipelines in the cloud, especially Google Cloud  
* Text analytics / NLP / text mining   
* Data visualizations using Shiny, Data Studio, Plotly or simple pencil on paper :)

A previous intro included my interest in music, especially bansuri, a traditional flute made of bamboo but I won't bore you with that here
